# Mine

## Issue 1

Claim: In any situation, the best way to persuade other people is to present them with facts and statistics rather than with emotional arguments.

Reason: Facts are objective, so they are more persuasive than subjective appeals.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.



There're those who opine that the best way to persuade people is offering facts and statistics, rather than emotional arguments in any situation. They <u>come to this conclusion based on</u> the assumption that facts are more persuasive due to its objectivity. In my view, despit the statement is <u>reasonable</u>, I believe emotional arguments can be advantgeous in some cases.

First, I acknowledge that persuading with facts and statistics has its glaring merits. Both facts and statistics are derived from reality, thus rendering them reliable and convingcing. As a result, People can easily check their truseness and validity. In this sense, less doubt can be cast on these evidences, which can be benificial for those who are afraid of get frustrated or cheated by others' deceptive words.  Another advantage comming from  persuading people objectivly is that  when faced with numbers and real reports, people are more likely to become calm and resanable, leading to them  to make rational decisions more easily.

Problems, however, inevitably ensue. One possible demerit is that objective entities, such as digits and graphic charts, can hardly touch people deeply.  A case in this point is that when Wenchuan Earthshake happened ten years ago, my classmates and me were shocked by the number of suffered people accounted by the government. And since we didn't fully understand the heavy meaning behind it, i hesitated to donate to them initially, which was an awkward experience. However, upon seeing the terrible scene on Telelevision and hearing the hosts' appeal for donation , I was immersed with emphty and saddness, thus finished the donation. This story vividly reveals the power of emotional arguments.  Therefore, facts and statictics are weak in such situations, in comparison with its emotional counterpart, which indicates that we can't simply apply them in all occasions. 

Actually, the nature of this issue is that the best way of persuading depends on the specific situation. On the one hand, objective statements are powerful to accelerate people's logical thinking. From this perspective, they may be helpful in career choosing and    business judgements. On the other hand, emotional arguments is appropriate for public events such as charity. <u>To explain this, we can look at the definition</u>, the purpose of  "persuation" is to make others convinced of what you are saying, and to give them reasons so that they cant't refute you. Besides, A "fact" is something cant't be refuted or disaproved. For example, scientific facts, all of which are established wisdom and have experienced empirical research, are undeniable. As a result, scienticific facts are typically more convincing than rumors or second testmonies. An emotional argument, in contrast, is  subjective and thus open to refute. However, it's designed to arise people's emotion or consciousness. Moreover, facts are often unequivacol statements, while emotional arguments are often vague.

In a nutshell, either of the two methods has its advantage. While objective facts contributing to critical thinking, they are less effient when calling forth emotional changes. As a result, the benefits of emotional arguments can't be underestimated.

Some people believe that success in creative fields, such as painting, fiction writing, and filmmaking, primarily requires hard work and perseverance. Others believe that such success mainly requires innate talents that cannot be learned.

Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.



==

The importance of or  acquired talents like  hard work and perseverance in creative fields, such as painting, fiction writing, and filmmaking in order to succeed has become an increasingly hot topic among people. While some people claim that it's those suceess require mianly innate talents, rathan than learned ones, I suppose the view is too short-sighted.

To begin with, we shouldn't doubt that innate talents like as creativity and  imagination are advantageous in that they are so closely related to human's mind, which still remains mysterious inspite of  the  advanced science. Moreover, because of this strong relation, they can influce people's emotion and mindset powerfully and deeply. As a result, these talents play an unreplacable role in  creative fields. Meanwhile, due to these talents' unique nature, they are actually more scarce in our society. Too fully under stand the point, just search those artistic jobs on Linkedin. We will find out that advanced occupations like animation  director and script writer are not only hot but also high paid in job market. In this sense, pofession relating to innate talents are normally considered hard and prospective. Therefore, it's not stange to think these qualities are more essential than those acquired ones to gain success.

However, hard work and perseverance will always play a fundamental part of the success of those fields. My primary judification is that if we look at the definition, "success" implies that we not only have our goal's required ability, which in this case is talent, but also take action to achieve it in reality. In other words, practice is a must to be successful. Because of that, the significance of pramatical qualities like hard work and perseverance can't be ignored. Another point supporting my stance is that we can improve our capibility though the progress of cultivating these qualities, thus becoming more competitive. Take myself for example,  I was a typically lazy student and always hesitated to try hard things, such as math problems. However, the situation changed during my last month whem preparing for GRE test, which required large amount of time and made me more delligent. 

In a nutshell, the nature of this issue is that the acievement of success is complex and influenced my enormous factors. While some people opine that some talents like innate talents are more essential than hard work and perseverance. I'm inclined that both of them are irreplaceable and are of major importance. Only when we give top priority to these qualities can we get prepared to success.

Claim: Group assignments that students must work together to complete should replace a substantial amount of traditional lecture-based instruction in college and university courses.

Reason: It is vital for students to gain experience collaborating with peers to study a topic and to achieve a common goal.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.

===

It's often debated that whether group assignments which need students to work together to accomplish should replace a number of raditional lecture-based instruction in college and university lessons. Some people claim that the replacement is nesseary besause of the importance of collaberation and accieving goals with peers. In my view, although the above claim is reasonable, those lecture-based instructions can still be nessary in some cases.

To begin with, we should not deny that group assignments involing collabration and mutual commiment is essential in modern colleges. As a matter of fact, several benifits could be gained from them. The most glaring merit is that students can have the chance to communicate with their peers through them, thus improving mutual understanding and cultivating friendship. Take myself for example, I used to wort as a teaching assitant with my roommate last semester and we worked together to design a new hownwork project for the lesson. Both my classmate and me got more friendly with each other after this experience. Meanwhile, since students could monitor their teammates'  performance during the assignment, they're more likely to be motivated by others' progress. As a result, their competitivity could get increased. A case in this point is that i used to be lazy during that TA career until i saw my roommate worked up late to catch up the deadline. I was so embarrassed at that time and eventually i changed my attitude to be  more diligent and productive. Besides, another advantage comming from group assignment is that our common goal could be achieved more easily through group work. One can  can ask group members for help when facing obstacles, thus making the progress faster.

However, traditional lecture-based instruction  still plays an fundamental part in college education. My primary judification is that accomplishing tasks alone is typically more challenging, in comparison with its counterpart, which in this sense is group assignment. And the gain could be propotional to the challenge. So as a result, student can maximize his competitivity through following tradition instructions.

Meanwhile, traditional lecture-based instruction, make a higher requirement on students' perseverence and courage. Considering the difficulty to finish a hard work by oneself, the traditional way is undoubtedly a great method to filter or promote those brave students.



In a nutshell, the nature of this issue is the difference of group and single activity. While group assignment has its advantage of collabration and mutual understanding, traditional ways are also fruitful and couldn't be overlooked. Only when we combine them, harness their merits and discard their demerits can we get more productive.

**When it comes to** discoveries, discoveries often occur when we unpectedly happen upon something in our quest for something else. **A variety of physical, linguistic and computer scientific discoveries buttress this point.** In Ancient Greece, while taking a bath, Archimede noticed that items could float on water, thus discovering buoyancy by serendipity. In eighteenth century, a group of linguists found a number of unknown symbols which indicated an ancient culture by accident. Several decaded ago, Dr. Church discovered new laws of operation, and finally summarized those rules as church numeral and lambda expression.

推理：

自己先说一个现象（和论点相关的，并且支持论点），这个现象好/不好，是因为（论点）。说白了就是自己基于原因后者现象把论点推理出来。

**When discussing** those great discoveries in recent decades, **we tend to claim that** they are mostly devised with detailed plans and foresighted strategies. **For example**, For eample, distributed Internet incorporated the technologies of computer hosts, stable protocols, information transmission media and a list of unnamed cutting-edge theories and technologies. So, these well planned assmble of many a state-of-the-art technology contributes to the birth of the modern computer networks. **The reason is simple.** Given distributed computing is a subject that covers enormous hosts and servers in many different places, this means we require a lot of researchers and engineers to set up the a number of base stations and to determine an efficient and reliable methods which make computer hosts communicate with each other. Such team mostly likely to systematically study the website and transmission pro2tocols. **In this way,** a riot of dicoveries and creations including real-time communication online and web applications, eventually dazzle the world. **Therefore**, it is detailed plans and foresighted strategies that help find out those great discoveries in recent decades.

讨论：

正反都提，其实就是设问。自己像一个人反方会提出的问题然后进行反驳。

Creations share something similar with those recent discoveries; that is, without careful planning seldom could people create anything meaningful. For example, the invention of heart diease drug which saved millions of lives is a well-planned process. **It can be argued that heart diease drug comes about by chance in the past few decades**. Most materials of the drug was found useful, when researcher feed them to rats. many attempts were made to figure out the purification process. **Although**, the inspiration for this creation and implementation might by serendipity, from the underlying chemistry principle to stimulation experiment, people worked through well planned. Without a great number of well-designed experiments on rats and volunteers, it is impossible to find the final recipe. Thus, it is a process containing a lot of plans that makes some creative idea realized.



# ARGUMENT

## Notes

1. When you read the argument. you are need to identify the following:  
   1. The **main conclusion**, main assertion, or main prediction 
   2. The **premises**, the evidence, or the 'facts' that led the author to this conclusion  

2. With the correct identification of the conclusion and the evidence, you then have to do something very important: REASON THE UNSTATED ASSUMPTIONS OUT. 
   * <u>This is where the bulk of your writing grade for the argument essay comes from.</u> 
   * Remember what ETS is looking for. They are looking for **your ability to deconstruct an argument in an analytical fashion** — they are not necessarily looking for your ability to write a TOEFL essay. In other words, they're asking you to think.  

3. Structures, templates, and 'one way' to write this essay are not essential. It says so right on ETS's website. However, we still want to have a structure in mind because it allows us to hit the ground running on test day. We can just start writing. 

4. Three body paragraphs are roughly the same thing with different content.  

5. **Make sure you follow the prompt's instructions.** 
   * If the prompt is asking you to ask questions, give evidence, about assumptions, to give alternate explanations, use the corresponding verbiage.  

6. All of this must be completed within **30 minutes**. We're not seeking perfection. We're seeking quality and completion.

Six months ago the region of Forestville increased the speed limit for vehicles traveling on the region's highways by ten miles per hour. Since that change took effect, the number of automobile accidents in that region has increased by 15 percent. But the speed limit in Elmsford, a region neighboring Forestville, remained unchanged, and automobile accidents declined slightly during the same six-month period. Therefore, if the citizens of Forestville want to reduce the number of automobile accidents on the region's highways, they should campaign to reduce Forestville's speed limit to what it was before the increase.



The argument is well-presented, but not thoroughly well-reasoned. Form the article, The author recommends that citizens of Forestville shouled decrease  local speed limit to what it was before the increase in order to reduce automobile accidents. To support this recommendation , the author  indicates that automobile accidents has declined slightly during the same six-month period in Elmsford, whose speed limit remained unchanged.  Carefully scrutiny of the author's argument reveals 3 unproven assumptions, which render the argument unconvincing.

To begin with, the author simple assumes that it's the increasement of Elmsford's speed limit that resulted in the automobile accidents growth, rather than some other phenomenon. It's possible that the accidents growth is resulted in by other factors, such as changes of local tranportation condition and periodical bad weather. Here's one example, the road could be muddy in rainy days, and the past months of Forestville may happen to be rainy, leading to accidents occuring.  In this sense, it's naturally for Forestville to experience a higher accident rate.Meanwhile, the local citizen may also play a pivotal role. Perhaps the population structure and  distribution changed during the six months. For example, young people tend to go to remote big citys to  work in some fixed months, thus making the elderly take the major fraction of local population. In this sense, older people are more likely to suffer accidents due to their poor cognitivity and slow reaction. <u>If any  of these scenarios has merit, then the conclusion drawn in the argument is significantly weakened.</u>

Additionally, Forestville and Elmsford may not be comparable. So the sample of Elmsford may not be representitave.On the one hand, It's possible that Elmsford decreased its number of accidents by several other measures, such as enlarging government's budget, improving road condition or strengthing the publicity of safe driving.  <u>Take the transport publicity for example</u>, through offical appeal and advertisement, it's possible that drivers in Elmsford can more aware of their safety while driving and consciously reduce their speed in spite of the same offical speed limit. On the other hand, perhaps Elmsford has its own advantage for reducing automobile accidents, and this couldn't be copied by other regions. For instance, the fraction of straightforward roads of all roads is higher in Elmsford, rendering it easier to have accidents. Besides, automobile transportation may play a less important role in local residents' lives. In other words, people there may have other tranportation choices such as taking planes or ships. <u>If the above is true, then the argument does not hold its water.</u>

Further, the author provides no evidence that the rise of automobile accidents is propotional to the increasement of speed limit. As a matter of fact, their connection may be weak. So the necessity of reducing ( or restoring ) the limit isn't fully illustrated. It's possible that Forestville has more dangerous roads or areas. Since these negative factors could have existed naturally, only changing the speed limit may not help. Another point that contribute to the ironic phenomenon is that the density or quantity of local tranportation in Forestville is higher than other regions, thus making it earsier to have accidents. <u>Without the evidence</u> that local automobile accidents would decrease because of this action <u>the argument is unconvincing.</u>

In a nutshell, The author's conclusion that  automobile accidents could be decreased by reducing the speed limit is easily arguable. To further bolster the argument the author must provide better evidence, perhaps by way of a reliable survey, that the speed limit has strong connection with the automobile accidents, and that the experience of Elmsford is also appropriate forForestville. The author must also demonstrate that by reducing the speed limit, the local residents can really enjoy the benefits of reduced automobile accidents.

The following memo was published by the Welzaton City Commission.

"A recent nationwide study of the effectiveness of wearing a safety helmet while bicycling indicates that ten years ago approximately 35 percent of all bicyclists reported wearing helmets, whereas today that number is nearly 80 percent. Another study, however, cites a 200 percent increase in the number of serious accidents involving bicycles during the same period. Meanwhile, results of a local survey of frequent bicycle riders indicate that 75 percent of those riders feel 'much safer' on busy roads when they wear helmets than when they don't. Clearly, the best explanation for the rise in bicycle-related accidents is that bicyclists take more risks now than they did ten years ago because they feel safer when they are wearing helmets."

Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanation(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument.

=====

The argument is well-presented, but not thoroughly well-reasoned. In this memo the Welzaton City Commission states that the  

pupolar action of wearing helmets is accountable for the rise in bicycle-related accidents. To justify this conclusion, the commission indicates the increasement of accidents and the survey result which revealed that a high proportion of  frequent bicycle riders fell much safer when waering helmets. However, <u>careful scrutiny of the argumentation reveals 3 unproven assumptions which render the argument unconvincing.</u>



To begin with, the commission fails to illustrate the change of the quantity of bicyclists during the 10 years, thus we can't infer from the result of the national study,which shows a gigantic growth of thepercentage of  accident , that the number of accidents has increased as well. It's possible that fewer people live in Welzaton City now and the total accident is relatively modest despite the high proportion. Meanwhile, the commission simply assumes the national study result is representitive of the situation in Welzaton City, whereas certain differences between regions can't be ignored. Perhaps Welzaton City has a far more complicated transportation, such as too many roads and narrow space in streets. Besides, it's possible that Welzaton City has a typically bad weather and the roads  easily become muddy, thus being uncomfortable for transportation. <u>If either of the senarios has merit, then the conclusion drawn in the argument is significantly weakened.</u>

Secondly, even if the number of accidents did rise substantially and the natural report result could be applied to the city, we do not know the fraction of frequent bicycle riders in the recent local survey referred. As a matter of fact, merely statements from frequent bicycle riders may not gurantee the attitude of major residents in Welzaton City, considering that these frequent riders may only take a minuscule percentage. What's more, their statements that they feel safer when wearing helmets don't indicate that they are more dangerous than others, becaouse the commsion provides no evidence that these frequent riders also have a high percentage of accidents, such as 75% mentioned. If the above is true, then the argument does not hold the water.

Finally, even if the commission can substantiate all of the previous assumptions, alternative explainations might also account for the problem, such as 

In a nutshell, <u>the conclusion is unpersuasive as it stands</u>. However, i<u>t is still possible that the conclusion is a valuable one</u>. To achieve this, the commission needs to <u>provide clear evidence, perhaps by way of a research study.</u> The commission also has to demonstrtes that the result of the national study is renpresentive enough to be applied to local area. I withhold my approval of the conclusion until the commission does these jobs well.

The following memorandum is from the president of Primo Doll Manufacturing, Inc.

"According to a survey last year of parents who purchased the Elkie, our most popular doll, 90 percent reported that although their children were extremely satisfied with the doll's features, the doll quickly wore out with use. In a follow-up survey of the same parents, 80 percent reported that they would recommend a more durable version of the doll to their friends. In response to these surveys, we have created the Elkie-Advanced Doll, which has similar features to the original Elkie Doll but is manufactured using the same higher quality materials used by Optima Doll Manufacturing, our most successful competitor. Because parents can now purchase the beloved Elkie doll and be sure that it won't quickly wear out with use, we predict that our profits will exceed those of Optima Doll Manufacturing this year."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the prediction and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the prediction.



====

The argument is well-presented, but not thoroughly well-reasoned. The president of Primo Doll Manufacturing  recommends that the company should produce the Elkie-Advanced Doll to make more profits. To support the recommendation, the author indicates that the befinits that could be gained from the evolution of the product. Careful scrutiny of this recommendation reveals 3 unproven assumptions, rendering the conclusion unconvincing.

To begin with, the author assumes too hastily that last year's situation will remain the same in the future. On the one hand, consumers's preferrence of the Elkie last year could  simply be a coincidence, or a result of annual fashion. Perhaps the Elkie looks same as some movies stars, whose movie were hot at that time. On the other hand, as the children growing, they may change their preferrence. As a result, parents might stop to purchase the doll. if either of the above scnarios has merit, then the conclusion drawn in the assumption is significantly weakened. 

Secondly, the author fails to incicate the fraction of the sell  of the Elkie in the company's total profit. So the financially effect if the doll's evolution is not accuratly incicated. Perhaps that the Elkie only makes up a few percentage of all products, thus making it's growth of selling meaningless. What's more, we have no information of the cost of the evolution. Perhaps the new material is too expensive. As a result,parents may not able to afford it. What's more, even if the change of price is modest, the profit may be reduced due to higher material cost. <u>If the above is true, then the argument does not hold the water.</u>

Finally, even though the author can substantiate all of the foregoing assumptions, merely growth in a specific product might not gurantee the company can outstripe its competitor. Anyway, we don't know the difference of the profits bwtween the two companies. Perhaps the Optima Doll Manufacturing is a far more large company, so that Primo Doll Manufacturing's profits can not outstripe it untill the Primo Doll Manufacturing itself becomes a larger company. Moreover, the Optima Doll Manufacturing might also adopt some changes or have some technical advancements in the following years, thus enlarging it's profits. 

In a nutshell, the conclusion relies on some dubious assumptions and is unpersuasive as it stands. However, it's still possible that the conclusion can be valuable. To further bolster the conclusion, the author need to provide more clear evidence, perhaps in the form of a research study. I withoud my approval of this conslusion until all of the problems above have been settled.
