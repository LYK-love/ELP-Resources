 “I'm gonna say parents should protect their children from making mistakes.”



Personally speaking, I prefer XXX, just because XXX saves me a lot of time/is a waste of time. 

You know, I'm a senior student and I major in SE. I have tons of work to do everyday like writing my assignment, tracing and dealing with  bugs, and preparing for the courses for the next day. I spent most of my time in laboratories and library everyday, and also I have to do some internships in my spare time. So I don't have any time to waste.

Well I have to admit that it's my personal preference. I prefer to XXX just because XXX. Therefore, I prefer XXX. 





take myself as an example



-  technology has also brought people together <u>by making it possible</u> for people to make new friends quickly. For instance, if you move to a new place and worry about making new friends, you can download some apps to look for people who share the same interests with you.
- people can contact their friends and family members <u>wherever they are and whenever they want</u>. For example, it doesn’t matter if I’m in China or the US, I can always send a message to my parents or even give them a phone call. However, without cellphone or internet, I cannot imagine how I can get in touch with my family while I’m abroad.



*  when I’m working, I don’t want my supervisor to check on me constantly.  
* That’d give me <u>a feeling of being watched</u> all the time.



* Having money and power <u>has very little to do with</u> a person’s success.
* have little impact on your contentment or fulfillment.



* <u>receive better education, experience new things, get more job opportunities and so on</u>.
*  the basic infrastructure in big city is perfect, because there are some museums, hospitals, schools, libraries and so on.

1. money:

   * I can <u>make more friends in different background/</u>from different cities/countries such as Japan, Canada and America/with the same interest. We could have <u>pleasant conversation</u> not only about <u>the academic information</u> such as history, biology and economics, but also abou<u>t the international events.</u> And I can also learn some useful interpersonal skills or personality such as honesty and persistence

4. environment:

   * The amazing part is its picturesque view and enjoyable surroundings. Having a walk beside the lake and rockery, I can smell the fragrance of grass and the flowers and hear the cries of the birds and feel the bracing breeze on my face.

5. stress:

   * I can totally relax in such a......environment. I’m <u>fascinated to the harmonious atmosphere</u> which could make me <u>refreshed and energetic</u>. I can <u>release my emotion, pressure and uneasiness</u> through it, and have a <u>temporary escape from the academic workload</u> such as assignment and examination.
   *  I often feel <u>so tired and stressed-out</u>, so I need to look for a way to relax. Doing sth is a pretty good choice. I mean, during the process, I can <u>forget all the stress in study</u>.

6. health:
   * It’s good for my health. I can improve my <u>speed, strength and flexibility</u>. And I can also effectively <u>lose weight and keep in good shape</u>. Before……I often got sick, depression and hot temper, but now, everything is getting much better.

7. learning

   * I can have an easier access to a huge amount of knowledge and information ranging from history to biology. For instance, it’ll be easy for me to polish my speaking and listening skills if ……/in such a……environment/ by……. This can render me a good opportunity to practice my English, and eventually put me in a favorable position in the upcoming competition.

For instance, if……I can <u>have a better understanding of the meaning of</u> life/career/education…..and <u>the importance of dream and future</u>. So, I will pay more attention to my family/friends/work/academic performance and also make great contribution to our society in the future.
9. peer pressure:

   * It is because of the <u>peer pressure</u>. You know, everyone in my class chooses to . I don’t wanna <u>be isolated from</u> them. Therefore I choose to do the same thing and involve with them.

10. relationship:

    * Fight: Last Friday afternoon, my friend Fancy and I decided to watch a movie together. We just had an argument about which movie to watch. At first, I was so frustrated and mad. Then I realized that I was wrong. I was not upset about the movie, I was upset about this TOEFL test, coz it meant too much to me. Then I apologized and explained to Fancy, and she forgave me. She gave me a warm hug and encouraged me. In the end, we were cool, and we watched a movie happily together.
    * Parents and child: Raising healthy, happy kids is a tough job. For parents, the most important thing is to build trust with your child, so that you child is willing to communicate with you and listen to your advice. Forcing children to make decision is not a wise thing to do. My parents respect me a lot, they often let me make decisions by myself, and let me express my own ideas and thoughts, so we have very good relationships with each other. Therefore, I want to listen to their suggestions while making choices, because I trust them

11. environment protection:

    * It is more eco-friendly, coz it’ll create little harmful carbon dioxide to the air. With the help of this, we can better protect our planet and prevent our environment from pollution such as global warming, acid rain and ozone layer. No one can deny that it is significant nowadays when we’re facing ecological crisis.
    * Protecting the environment is very important, because the world we live in is our only home. Last summer, I joined an environmental protection club named Beautiful Home. Once, we collected the recyclable rubbish in the downtown, such as plastics, cans, bottles and so on. Then we sent them to the recycle center. I think this kind of activity can not only make full use of the natural resources, but also strengthen citizens’ awareness of environmental protection.(make full use of the natural resources)

12. culture:

    * It can definitely help me improve the understanding of the culture, custom, history and many interesting stuff about a different country/city. <u>The deeper insight into culture can not only broaden my horizon but also help me comprehend the living style and thinking mode of the local people</u>.

13. family time:

    * More importantly, I can go home more frequently and visit my parents and grandparents. My mom will prepare me the food I like the most; my father will talk to me and help me figure out a way to solve the problem I encounter at school. My feeling can be best described by an old saying, “East, West, home is the best”
    * Family <u>always comes first, I mean, they are the most important people in our lives. For example, I have been living with my parents for 20 years, so we are very familiar with each other. we know each other’s different personality and habits. Therefore, it’s easy for us to communicate and we get along pretty well. Being with them just makes me happy and relaxed. What’s more, my parents are the people who love me the most in the world. They give me support and encouragement without any condition. I trust them a lot!</u>

14. employment rate:

    * It will contribute to the increase of employment rate. I mean, it can provide the local people with a large amount of jobs. As a result, it would in turn bring benefits to the social stability and economic development.

15. security:

16. privacy:

    * It can help me protect my privacy. Coz being attended sometimes makes me feel uncomfortable. I don’t like others to know what books I am reading or what songs I am listening. Sometimes I just need some private time and deal with my personal stuff like calling my friends and writing the letter to my mom
    * Doing sth without others permission is impolite and rude, because it invades others’ privacy. It may cause conflict between each other and jeopardize the relationship. I mean, everyone has his or her own privacy. Invading it shows no respect to others. In the end, you may end up with an argument or a physical fight. What’s more, it has a negative effect on people’s mood.

17. 坏习惯

    > It is embarrassing to say that some people have terrible manners. For example, someone in my class always spits and litters in public, which make me feel really awful. You know, I’m pissed off by those behaviors and can not stand them at all. So I have no choice but to_____.

18. portability:

    > It is not heavy and big like the others; it’s portable so I can take it anywhere. For instance, I can……on the bus, in the library or in the dining hall. You see, the convenience is undeniable.

19. platable:

    > I can have some tasty food. It serves the amazing dumpling of all kinds of flavors, pork flavor, chicken flavor and so on. One thing I like the most is the caraway there, it really help enrich the taste of dumplings. Anyway, it never fails to make my mouth water.

20. humor:

    > The humorous style could also develop my sense of humor. This will make others more willing to listen to my stories and bring fun to my life and the lives of others. Consequently, it can improve my interpersonal skills and make me more popular.

21. bravety

    > You’ve got to have faith and courage; the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. In this rapid developing society, if we’re easily freaked out by various challenges, then there’s no way we can succeed.

22. Good example:

    > Since he is the role model for us, he needs to speak and behave appropriately, in order to set a good example for us. No one can deny that a good example can exert an profound influence on the people.

23. keep faith:

    > He is a man of his word and he never breaks his promise. I remember once I asked him to pick up my cousin when I couldn’t come back. He did so even though he had caught a bad cold. I said thanks and sorry but he said it’s ok because he promised me. It is the characteristic of keeping faith enabled him to win my complete trust.

24. healthy diet:

    * Having healthy diet plays a very important role in our lives, because a healthy body is the foundation of everything. However, a lot of people pay less attention to their diet because they are too busy. For example, I often eat some fast food, such as French fries, hamburger, fried chicken, and so on. They contain high calorie and fat, which are harmful to my health. I think I should learn some cooking skills and cook some healthy food at home.

25. difficulty of work

    * You know what, being a ... is not an easy thing, because every day you need to spend a lot of time doing ..., such as,...,..., and ... Take my friend Fancy as an example. She is a ... She works very hard every day in order to ... I really admire her from the bottom of my heart. Without ...'s work, we can't ...

26. part time job

    * I think doing part time jobs is a good way for us to accumulate some practical working experience. Last year, I had an internship in a fortune 500 company called Lenovo. It was a great experience for me, coz I learned some useful knowledge and skills, such as time management, teamwork, organization, customer service and so on. All these can lay a solid foundation for my future career. Also, I can make some money by doing a part-time job.

27. efficiency

    * When you are doing important tasks, you should be <u>100% focused and concentrated</u>, because in this way, you can finish the tasks <u>on time with high quality</u>. I am a student who needs to finish a lot of homework every day, I usually... in order to keep my mind on work. However, if I..., it’s very easy for me to get distracted.

28. Class discussion

    * Group discussion is very beneficial for students because <u>two heads are better than one</u>. When participating in group discussion, students can <u>work together to exchange different ideas and thoughts,</u> and they can learn from each other. I often discuss some difficult problems in study with my classmates, and they can offer me different perspectives to solve the problem. it’s very efficient. What's more, <u>participation can add interest and engage students, because they can encourage each other.</u>

29. Live independently

    * When I was a little kid, my parents taught me some life skills to cultivate my independence. For example, like, um, when I got 6? Or 7 years old? they taught me how to do some basic housework(household tasks), such as doing laundry, washing dishes, vacuuming the floor and so on. Now, I am studying in a city which is far away from my hometown, but I can totally take care of myself and live independently. It’s not a difficult thing for me to adapt to the university life.

30. Technology:

    * paperbook and E-book:

      * Libraries play an essential role in providing educational resources centers for everyone in the community. At a library, every resource there is free, including books, internet access, and educational programs. I often go to the school library, because I am a university student who needs to write a lot of research papers. I go to the library to read some reference books and journals for my papers and use the free internet to search for related information. What’s more, the atmosphere in the library is very good. I mean, it’s very quiet and comfortable so that I can be 100 percent focused on study.

      Though e-books become more and more popular, a lot of people, including me, still like to read paper books. I like reading paper books simply because I like the feeling. I mean, I can smell them, feel them and touch them. During the process, I can use my pen to write down some notes on the books. I can totally focus on the reading. However, it’s very easy for me to get distracted when reading e-books. Like I may browse some other websites with the electronic device.

    * Internet:

      * The Internet is one of the greatest creations, because it gives everyone with <u>**instant access to an endless supply of knowledge and entertainment**</u>. For example, using a search engine like Google, you can <u>ask any question and find a web page with an answer to that question</u>. When I meet some problems in study, I often find the answer online. It’s very efficient and convenient. What’s more, with the internet, you can communicate with anyone in the world in less than a minute. You can send an e-mail or make a visual call.

31. Teenagers

    * Kids and teenagers are not mature enough, so they can’t tell the right from the wrong. They naturally imitate some bad behaviors and attitudes around them. For e.g., I have a cousin whose name is Bob. He is 7 years old, and he is very violent. He often beats people, especially his peers in school. That’s because he often watches some action movies on TV, and those movies contain violence and bad language. Therefore, it’s very important for the government, schools and parents to make concerted efforts to protect the kids from the negative influence.

32. Communicate

    * Having face-to-face communication is better because the communication is more **efficient**. Every time when I meet some troubles in study, I will <u>make an appointment</u> with my professors and talk to them directly in person. During the process, I can <u>propose my questions</u>, and they can give me the answers. We can <u>use our body language</u> to help us illustrate the points, so that we can <u>understand each other better</u>.

      What’s more, having face-to-face communication can strengthen the relationship among people.

33. Education

    * Art:
      * Learning art is very important, because it can develop <u>creative thinking, broaden the mind and feed the soul</u>. When I was in high school, my favorite subject was painting class. Our painting teacher often took us to the <u>art galleries or museums to watch some art exhibitions</u>. I learned a lot of background knowledge and skills about painting pictures, such as how to use the brush, how to structure the picture, and how to match the color. What's more, I also appreciated some masterpieces from some great artists, such as Van Gogh, Picasso and so on.
